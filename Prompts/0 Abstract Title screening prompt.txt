Title + Abstract Screening Instructions

INCLUDE the record if, based on title/abstract, ALL of the following are likely true:
1) The article is a meta-analysis or systematic review.
2) It focuses on ADHD and/or developmental dyslexia / reading disability.
3) It examines cognitive functioning, such as:
   – working memory
   – executive function / inhibitory control
   – attention
   – processing speed / speed of processing
   – phonological processing / RAN
   – other neurocognitive skills
4) It either:
   – compares individuals with ADHD or dyslexia to neurotypical controls, OR
   – adopts a dimensional/continuous perspective linking cognitive performance to ADHD/dyslexia traits.

EXCLUDE the record if ANY of the following apply:
– Not a meta-analysis or systematic review.
– Not focused on ADHD or dyslexia/reading disorder.
– Does not examine cognitive functioning (e.g., only symptoms, diagnosis, behavior).
– Focuses on intervention, treatment, rehabilitation, or medication effects.
– Focuses only on prevalence, diagnostic classification, or neurobiological outcomes without cognitive results.
– Compares clinical groups only (e.g., ADHD vs ASD; ADHD with comorbidities).
– No neurotypical control group when the approach is categorical.
– Non-human studies.

Definitions & Notes:
Cognitive outcomes of interest include working memory, inhibitory control, attention (e.g., sustained/selective), processing speed, phonological processing, rapid automatized naming (RAN), and standard neuropsychological measures (e.g., Wechsler subtests). Eligible designs include meta-analyses comparing clinical groups with controls or meta-analytic correlations between cognitive performance and symptom severity in general population samples. Not eligible are treatment-focused meta-analyses, or reviews that only examine etiology, neural mechanisms, prevalence, or diagnostic issues without cognitive outcomes.

Output
Your output should only be "0" or "1" (numeric).
