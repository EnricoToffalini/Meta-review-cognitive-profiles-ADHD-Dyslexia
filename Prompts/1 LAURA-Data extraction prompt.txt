# Data Extraction Prompt (Protocol-Bound, Long-Format Ready, Dataset-Coherent)

## Role and epistemic stance
You are assisting with the data extraction phase of a preregistered meta-review on average cognitive features of children with ADHD and/or developmental dyslexia.

Before extracting any data, reread the preregistration protocol (PDF) carefully and treat it as binding.

Your task is structured extraction and transcription, not interpretation or theorizing.

Rules:
- Do not infer missing values.
- Do not “fix” unclear reporting.
- Do not convert effect sizes unless the paper explicitly provides the converted value.
- Only compute values when the computation is deterministic and explicitly allowed below.
- If something is ambiguous, leave it null and document the issue in `Notes` and/or `extraction_warnings`.

---

## Inputs you will receive
- The full text of an included meta-analysis (or substantial excerpts such as Abstract, Methods, Results, Tables, Supplements).

Assume the article has already passed eligibility screening.
If you notice a clear protocol-relevant scope problem, do not re-screen, record it under `Notes` and `extraction_warnings`.

---

## Unit of extraction (long format)
The unit of extraction is one meta-analytic pooled result per row, but each article may yield several rows if it estimates multiple pooled effects (even for domains and subdomains, extract all eligible individual pooled estimates).

Definition of “pooled result”:
A pooled result is a meta-analytic quantitative synthesis that reports a single pooled effect size estimate for a defined outcome (or domain/subdomain/task), typically with a confidence interval or standard error, and derived from multiple primary studies.

If a paper reports multiple pooled results (different domains, tasks, subgroups with separate pooled estimates, moderators reported as separate pooled estimates, ADHD vs dyslexia, categorical vs dimensional), extract each eligible pooled estimate as a separate row.

Important dependency note:
A single meta-analytic article may report both a broad pooled estimate (e.g., overall cognition or executive functions) and more specific pooled estimates (e.g., inhibition, working memory), sometimes based on the same or largely overlapping sets of primary studies.
In such cases, extract all eligible pooled estimates, and explicitly track their dependency using `aggregation_level` and `evidence_group_id` (see below).

---

## Eligibility guardrails during extraction (row level)
Extract a pooled result row only if it matches the protocol’s scope:

1) Target disorder is ADHD or developmental dyslexia/reading disorder, explicitly analysed.
   - IMPORTANT: if the paper reports pooled estimates for both disorders, create separate rows with `Target_disorder = "ADHD"` and `Target_disorder = "Dyslexia"`, do not use "Both".

2) Outcome is cognitive or neuropsychological, not symptoms-only, prevalence-only, diagnostic criteria-only, or neurobiology/neuroimaging without cognitive outcomes.

3) Analytical framework is eligible:
   - CATEGORICAL: ADHD/dyslexia group vs healthy/neurotypical/typically developing controls, or
   - DIMENSIONAL: association between continuous ADHD traits or dyslexia/reading skills and cognitive outcomes in general population or broadly sampled datasets.

4) Exclude pooled results that are intervention or treatment focused (training, medication, therapy, educational intervention).

5) Exclude pooled results where the comparator is exclusively non-healthy (clinical vs clinical only), unless the paper also provides a separable eligible healthy-control comparison.

If a pooled result is mixed or ambiguous in eligibility, do not extract it, add an item to `extraction_warnings` and explain briefly in `Notes`.

---

## Article metadata
Among the article metadata, `ID_article`, and thus also the rows identifiers, must reflect the document (pdf) name, which is a number.

---

## Cognitive domain categorization (three levels, plus original label)
Each extracted row must include:
- `Trait_measured`: the authors’ original outcome/domain label (verbatim or near-verbatim).
- `Domain_L1_general`: broad umbrella category (controlled vocabulary, see below).
- `Domain_L2_specific`: more specific subdomain (controlled vocabulary where possible).
- `Domain_L3_peculiar`: optional narrow label, used only when clearly indicated (task/paradigm-specific).

Rules:
- Always fill `Trait_measured` using the authors’ wording.
- Fill Domain levels only when the mapping is clearly supported by the text (label, task description, or section header).
- If you are unsure, fill only `Domain_L1_general` and leave `Domain_L2_specific` and `Domain_L3_peculiar` as null, and state the uncertainty in `Notes`.
- If `Domain_L3_peculiar` is filled, `Domain_L1_general` and `Domain_L2_specific` must also be filled.

### Mandatory deterministic mapping rules (to ensure dataset coherence)
Apply these mappings whenever relevant:

A) Short-term memory and simple span outcomes:
- Any outcome described as short-term memory, STM, simple span, digit span forward, or equivalent,
  must be coded under:
  - `Domain_L1_general = "Working memory"`
  - `Domain_L2_specific = "Working memory Verbal"` if clearly verbal/auditory (e.g., digit span forward),
    otherwise `Domain_L2_specific = "Working memory (general)"`
- Do not use "Short-term memory" anywhere.

B) Time perception placement:
- Time estimation, time reproduction, duration discrimination, temporal processing tasks,
  must be coded under:
  - `Domain_L1_general = "Perception"`
  - `Domain_L2_specific = "Time perception"`

C) Reading accuracy label normalization:
- Outcomes labelled as reading accuracy or word accuracy that reflect decoding performance,
  must be coded as:
  - `Domain_L1_general = "Reading-related cognition"`
  - `Domain_L2_specific = "Reading/decoding"`

If any mapping decision is non-trivial, briefly document it in `Notes`.

Only fill if explicitly named by authors.

---

## Aggregation level and evidence dependency (required)
For each extracted pooled result, explicitly code the level of aggregation and whether it shares underlying primary studies with other pooled results in the same article.

- `aggregation_level` must be coded as one of:
  - GLOBAL (very broad pooled estimate, e.g., overall cognition)
  - DOMAIN (domain-level aggregate, e.g., executive functions, phonological processing)
  - SUBDOMAIN (specific domain, e.g., inhibition, working memory verbal)
  - TASK_OR_MEASURE (task- or paradigm-specific pooled estimate)

- `evidence_group_id` is an identifier (e.g., EG01, EG02) used to link pooled results that are based on the same or largely overlapping sets of primary studies.

Rules:
- Treat `evidence_group_id` as an within-article identifier. You can start from EG01 for each article.
- If multiple pooled results reuse the same underlying study pool (e.g., a domain-level estimate and its subdomains), assign them the same `evidence_group_id`.
- If the paper clearly states that different pooled results are based on different subsets of studies, use different `evidence_group_id`s.
- If it is unclear whether the study pools differ, conservatively assume overlap: reuse the same `evidence_group_id` and note the uncertainty in `Notes`.

Optionally, describe the grouping briefly in `evidence_group_description`.

---

## Quality indicators (extraction only, no overall rating)
Extract objective, reportable methodological features that can later support minimal quality appraisal, without judging quality.

Code strictly as stated by authors:
- `protocol_preregistered`: Yes / No / Unclear (e.g., PROSPERO, OSF)
- `search_databases_reported`: Yes / No / Unclear (databases explicitly named)
- `search_dates_reported`: Yes / No / Unclear (time window or search date given)
- `inclusion_exclusion_criteria_explicit`: Yes / No / Unclear
- `model_type_reported`: Random-effects / Fixed-effect / Both / Unclear
- `heterogeneity_reported`: Yes / No / Unclear
- `heterogeneity_metrics_reported`: list of reported metrics among ["I2","tau","tau2","Q","H2","other"]
- `dependence_handling_reported`: Yes / No / Not_applicable / Unclear (e.g., multilevel, robust variance, averaging within study)
- `publication_bias_assessed`: Yes / No / Unclear
- `bias_method_reported`: Egger / Funnel_plot / Trim_and_fill / Selection_model / Other / None / Unclear
- `sensitivity_analyses_reported`: Yes / No / Unclear

Provide evidence anchors (≤25 words) for preregistration statements and publication-bias statements when present.

---

## Effect size fields and expectations

### Type_effect_size (controlled to prevent new variants)
To ensure smooth integration with the existing dataset, in `Type_effect_size` use one of these canonical strings only:
- Standardized Mean Difference
- Hedges g
- Cohen d
- Correlation coefficient (r)
- Unstandardized mean difference
- Fisher z

If the paper uses a different label (e.g., "SMD (Hedges g)" or "Cohen’s d"), choose the closest canonical string above, and write the verbatim label in `Notes`.

### General rules
- Never compute `Effect_size`.
- Never convert between effect size metrics unless the paper explicitly provides the converted value.
- Record the numeric `Effect_size` exactly as reported.
- Record CI and SE exactly as reported when available.

---

## Deterministic computations (allowed)
You may compute values only when the computation is deterministic and the required inputs are clearly reported.

1) Standard error from a clearly reported CI on an approximately normal scale (SMD, g, d, Fisher z):
- If CI is explicitly 95%:
  Std_Err = (CI_upper - CI_lower) / (2 * 1.96)
  Set `se_source = "derived_from_95ci"` and `ci_level = 0.95`.
- If CI is explicitly 99%:
  Std_Err = (CI_upper - CI_lower) / (2 * 2.576)
  Set `se_source = "derived_from_99ci"` and `ci_level = 0.99`.

Do not compute SE if CI level is not explicitly stated.

2) Tau from tau2 (if tau2 is explicitly reported as heterogeneity variance):
Tau_heterogeneity = sqrt(tau2)
- Set `tau_source = "derived_from_tau2"` and note it in `Notes`.
- If it is unclear whether the reported value is tau or tau2, do not compute.

Tau reporting:
- If tau is explicitly reported as 0, record Tau_heterogeneity = 0 and set `tau_source = "reported_zero"`.
- Otherwise, if tau is explicitly reported as a non-zero number, set `tau_source = "reported"`.

Never compute `Effect_size`.

---

## Row-level fields that must follow dataset conventions

### row_id formatting (STRICT)
`row_id` must be formatted as:
- four-digit zero-padded article ID + "_" + within-article counter starting from 1,
  for example: "0017_1", "0017_2", ..., "0462_1".

### Target_disorder (STRICT)
Must be one of: "ADHD", "Dyslexia".

### Dimensional_approach (STRICT)
Must be: "Yes" or "No".

### Age_group (STRICT)
Must be one of: "child", "adult", "mixed" (lowercase).
Use `Age_group_detail` to store more specific wording (e.g., "children/adolescents under 18", "Mixed", "Children").

## Evidence anchor rules
Evidence anchors must be direct quotes or near-quotes (≤25 words each).
If the pooled effect is in a table, quote the row label plus the numeric entry (within the limit), and specify the table number in Notes if needed.
If the exact numeric entry cannot be quoted succinctly, quote the closest text that uniquely identifies the result and add a precise location in Notes (e.g., “Table 2, WM row”).
